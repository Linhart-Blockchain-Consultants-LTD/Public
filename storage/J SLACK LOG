Great thanks

Jesse [9:17 AM]
Hey Troy, is it possible to produce that list of tasks that I mentioned before for the bug bounty program? The ones that are eligible and ineligible?
This is a foreign language to me I'm a finance/numbers guy. Leo asked me to ask you about it.
Theoretically it should take you probably 10 minutes max.
The rest is complete besides that list.

Troy Linforth [9:56 AM]
Do you have a copy of the live website on a testing/staging environment ?

Jesse [9:56 AM]
Please direct that question to Levon Tikoyan

Troy Linforth [10:09 AM]
Will do, Levons gotten back that there’s no testing environment so we can replace the “website” with the live links

Standard out of scope information:

Scheduled infrastructure changes
DDoS/DoS attacks
Any bugs which do not compromise account or user security
Any bugs caused by operating system virtualization or emulation
Spamming
Social engineering (including phishing) of Elysian staff or contractors

Scope.

Any exploits or bugs relating to;
“Main website” eg https://elycoin.io
-“token sale website” 
-“token sale contract” 
-“token contract”


I’m not sure the specifics for the token sale website address, and for the token sale contract and token contract, if you’ve got a version live on the testnet use that one

Jesse [10:12 AM]
Sounds great, thanks for the help.

Troy Linforth [7:56 PM]
Hey Jesse, We are ready to move forwards with expanding the team and they’ve officially been assigned, We’ve been actively assisting and will continue assisting with the TGE but this should help take the load off and provide better protection to Elysian and the community. (edited)

Jesse [8:02 PM]
I see
What do you mean by this specifically, that you need your payment?
I don't completely understand
Unless, do you mean with website surveillance?
Thanks for the help btw we are very grateful to have you guys around.

Troy Linforth [8:09 PM]
I’m just letting you know that we’ve completed the security audit and now as planned have assigned the team member to assist with the TGE work.
The invoice has a few days before it’s due date so whenever that can be taken care of let me know.

And no problem, it’s one of the reasons we added another person so there’s more of us around, and extra pair of hands or eyes comes in hand when the unexpected hits! You can’t prepare for things like that but you can do your best to fix it once it’s happens

Jesse [8:10 PM]
Yeah I mean I'm so upset at this Applicature issue I could lose my mind.
Thanks for deploying more guys
I understand it rarely goes perfectly but to have a 2 and a half hour delay at the beginning just
I mean I have some choice words for those guys
Especially because they completely lack professionalism
If you knew how they handled these situations you would laugh out loud

Troy Linforth [8:13 PM]
There’s still some issues with the dash that are causes the bad rejections.

Oh from some of the previous dashboard issues and how they continue to be small things that went unfixed i can imagine

Jesse [8:15 PM]
I saw that but I don't know why if it's not a gas issue

Troy Linforth [8:15 PM]
Something to do with that users account I’d say, as it’s only individual users, not widespread in anyway
Okay
If they did something
Tell them to do more of it
Cause it went in
