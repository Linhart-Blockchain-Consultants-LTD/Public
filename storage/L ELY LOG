I’ve got it enabled for contacts only as otherwise I wake up to hundreds of new groups, add me as a contact and it should let you add me
[8:23:12 PM] Leo:
It’s still not possible
[8:23:54 PM] Troy:
Now that you’ve shared contact details it should work, but I’ll disable it for now

[12:08:14 AM] Troy:
One of the three accounts removed today, I’ve also sent you a message on Slack when you’ve got time, feel free to reply on here or slack
[1:38:43 AM] Leo:
Thanks for the update troy
I will get back to you regarding the expansion
I had one other super important question
After doing the Smart contract audit. Are you 100% positive we won’t have any issues with it?
[1:58:05 AM] Troy:
Look forward to hearing from you about that and there shouldn’t be any issues with the smart contract, it functions as intended and is free from several well know exploits and issues that arise from mistakes in code
[2:56:01 AM] Troy:
Try to get back to me before the start of the week if it’s possible so we can start off Monday
[9:40:54 PM] Troy:
Hey Leo, KJ got in touch about the penetration testing thats been suggested, While im still going over the details KJ gave me, I wanted to suggest that if We went  ahead with expanding the team.

I can assign one of our staff with CPTE qualifications and We can perform the pentest at no additional cost.

Let me know what your thoughts are on this as We’d like to get the ball rolling if indeed We are to conduct the pentesting.
[10:17:11 PM] Troy:
Ive also updated you on slack with some more removed accounts processed today.

--- Monday, May 28, 2018 ---
[11:58:51 AM] Troy:
Hey Leo if your able to update me with your thoughts on the above today it'll help us work out our staff allocation and availability, Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

--- Tuesday, May 29, 2018 ---
[8:38:29 AM] Troy:
Pinging this to get the ball rolling and get your feedback.
[9:38:33 AM] Leo:
Hey Troy,

What would it cost to expand the team?
[9:42:15 AM] Troy:
It would be the 10% so $5,000 of our existing fee for us to add an additional member and have them perform the pentesting and then assist with the increase in phishing/social engineering/malicious activity.
[10:06:00 AM] Troy:
We can have the pentesting complete in 24-48 hours if we decide to move forward with the expansion
[10:36:49 AM] Troy:
with 6 days before the public sale starts the quicker this is sorted the sooner any issues can be fixed before it becomes a serious issue.
Let me know if you want to move forward and ill get things moving
[2:25:29 PM] Troy:
also with the continued phishing on Twitter, Verification would enable higher visibility and security while also providing engagement with other verified users, while twitter have closed public verifications private applications are still being accepted, there’s a few things required to process the application so I’ll forward you some details via email

--- Wednesday, May 30, 2018 ---

Please update me on this Leo, With only five days left it’s cutting it close if we find any issues

Only 5 Days Remaining in the Elysian Private Sale!
The Elysian private sale, which started in mid-April, is now nearing its completion. The event has only been open to private contributors…
KJ
[11:13:22 AM] Leo:
Troy you mean 5,000 on top of the deal we agreed?
[11:14:15 AM] Troy:
No the $5000 is 10% of our existing service fee
So we would receive 10% now for bringing an additional team member on to perform the testing and the remainder as set out in the service agreement
edited 
The invoice We've sent you shows theres no charge for the additional team member and penetration testing, The only line item is a Service Fee Part Payment.
It will be needed to increase the team from whats in the service agreement so We can take care of this and have extra hands onboard during the ICO.

[10:06:00 PM] Leo:
I think someone wanted to find out my correct email
To see which one doesnt bounce back
[10:20:43 PM] Troy:
Yeah thats someone doing some basic recon
Anything you have used that email for login or signup wise should already have either a password from LastPass that won’t be easily found or cracked and anything that can have 2FA should have it on

Hey Leo could you check your spam mail and see if theres any other emails like this one.
[3:35:20 PM] Leo:
The guy send me another one
[3:49:14 PM] Troy:
spam caught it or just he sent another today?
[3:49:22 PM] Leo:
Another sent today
[3:49:35 PM] Troy:
to the same addresses ?
or just to yours now ?
[5:21:43 PM] Leo:
same addresses
[5:58:39 PM] Troy:
alright just keep an eye on it for now
he knows the address so he shouldn't be sending another one

Never wrote with him before so I think he also tried to see if it gets bounced back or not.

more likely just testing the mailbox and seeing if you do

Dear Friends!

We have confirmed that we was under attack. Less than 1% of our users received fake emails, allegedly on our behalf, with the request to provide private keys. We successfully resisted this attack! The domain of intruders in the .TECH zone, which simulates our domain, is blocked by the hosting provider!

PLEASE BE CAREFUL!
1) DO NOT click on links and
2) DO NOT provide them any information!
3) DO NOT tell anyone your private keys!

All your tokens are safe in your personal account on https://sale.sharpay.io!

We are investigating the attack. We will keep you informed about the latest news about our situation. Please read all our news only on our official social networks on https://sharpay.io.

We will issue ERC20 Sharpay tokens in mid-late June, and in July we will go onto exchanges. We will announce the agreements with exchanges in June. A special field for adding your ETH address is now hidden in our settings and will appear in your account in mid-late June 2018.

You will be able to add your current ETH address BY YOURSELF.

The Transfer of ERC20 Sharpay tokens to your personal ETH addresses will begin in late June, early July.

We will NOT ask and have NOT asked for your private keys!

Can we make sure this doesn’t happen to us?
[10:59:32 AM] Troy:
I’ll take a look into what happened but if it’s what I think it is, they set up a fake website @ https://sharpay.tech and somehow gained less then 1% of the users emails, this could be via BitcoinTalk, Bounty’s or other phishing methods.
If it is that, your protected against this as are scanning for these types of scams

Hey Leo I’ve been updated on the current situation and the potential plans to conduct a second TGE in 12 months time due to the current market sentiment, We are open to being onboard during this time in an advisory role, and assisting during the next TGE period.

Once the details have been confirmed We will present an update to our service agreement outlining the changes that have been discussed
[9:23:57 PM] Leo:
Hey Troy,

I'll get back to you within the next couple days once I have a bit more time but I will have much more opportunities for you in the future. I'll try to give you a call to explain the details etc.
[9:36:58 PM] Troy:
Hey Leo, Understandably things are quite busy right now, feel free to let me know when you’ve got some free time and we’ll speak more about that

--- Friday, June 29, 2018 ---
[3:49:02 PM] Troy:
Hey Leo, I just wanted to let you know that if in the future the domain name changes make sure you let us know, I remember someone saying that the current address was only for the TGE.

We will keep monitoring the current addresses for any activity but the Twitter scams have already moved off to other ICO’s as it’s harder to pull those scams when the ICO is finished, so we don’t expect much activity heading towards the end of the ICO on the 8th :+1:🏻
[6:53:48 PM] Leo:
Let's talk beginning of next week.
Will have more updates by then
Sounds good! Will def. do
[6:54:30 PM] Troy:
That works great for me. I’ll be available whenever your around beginning of next week.

--- Monday, July 2, 2018 ---
[10:22:32 AM] Troy:
Hey Leo, Let me know what Timezone your currently on, I’ll be available for most of today to discuss the future opportunity’s and go over our protection of the ICO
[9:33:31 PM] Leo:
Can we do tomorrow 1pm SGT?
[9:36:03 PM] Troy:
Tomorrow 1pm SGT should be fine :+1:🏻, I’ll have a brief rundown of the actions taken during the ICO during the call and let you know about the services that will stay in place after the 8th

--- Tuesday, July 3, 2018 ---
[11:56:00 AM] Troy:
Hey Leo We’ll need to reschedule our call, if tomorrow at the same time is good for you I’ll be around and available then
I’ll email you our AAR for you to look over today before our call tomorrow

--- Wednesday, July 4, 2018 ---

[6:16:11 PM] Troy:
Hey Leo we've had to postpone sending our AAR after the recent issues that have come up overnight, once we get these resolved and written up ill get that to you.

--- Thursday, July 5, 2018 ---
[2:32:59 PM] Troy:
Hey Leo I just want to give you a quick update.

We have worked with MetaMask to blacklist the following domains

+    "ethe.mediumblog.top"
+    "eth.mediumblog.top"
+    "claim.ether33.online"
+    "any.ether33.online"
+    "mediumblog.org"
+    "swswd.ether33.online"
+    "swdwd.ethers444.online"
+    "eth22.mediumblog.top"

These should become active over the next 24 hours, some are already actively blocked.

Google Safe Browsing will take 24-48 hours.

SSL Certificate removal will take place 24-48 hours after Google Safe Browsing respond and update their platform.

Rest assured that users are safe, from investigation we have not been able to discover any users whom have fallen for these scams.

Elysian Token Sale AAR
After Action Report for the Elysian ICO
[7:32:07 PM] Leo:
Hey Troy,

Just super busy. I should have more time in a couple of days.
About the etherscan
How can I fix it? To be the first coin for elycoin and elysian?
Or even ELY?
edited 
[7:33:49 PM] Troy:
So the instructions I sent will make the etherscan page for that fake ELY look like this one
https://etherscan.io/address/0x5208d7f63a089906889a5a9caed81e9c889e64f8
etherscan.io
Ethereum Accounts, Address and Contracts
The Ethereum BlockChain Explorer, API and Analytics Platform
with a big "Warning! There are reports that this address was used in a Phishing scam. Please exercise caution when interacting with this address." on the address, it wont be able to trick users and wont be shown when searching for token names, as its nickname like this account is now named "phishingxx"
[7:35:21 PM] Leo:
But the issue I see
It was created240 days ago
Looking like it was just another project creating it perhaps we will have many more Elysian/ELY projects?
[7:39:03 PM] Troy:
I really dont know why they picked Elysian as a token name, over a two day period they made several tokens with names like  RunescapeGP and RAVN
We havn't been able to tie the address to any entity or indivudal, and once the above is done it wont be found or called "elysian" it will be called "fake elysian token" to stop them from being able to use it
[7:55:36 PM] Leo:
Troy
check the email I forward
could be super
urgent
[8:05:24 PM] Troy:
Taking a look now at that
What are you using for an email service?
[9:42:53 PM] Leo:
Gsuite/Gmail
[11:41:43 PM] Troy:
His PoC is technically correct, It cant not be thats the problem
https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en
Google
About DKIM - G Suite Administrator Help
You can help prevent spoofing by adding a digital signature to outgoing message headers using the DKIM standard. This involves using a private domain...
I'd resolve the issue then address the bounty
You can use his PoC to fake an email from ANY email address, Let me be clear on that, You can use a .mil or even .gov mailbox to send via his PoC. ANY email address is fooled via this, but DKIM should be enabled to help with the spam filtering

--- Saturday, July 7, 2018 ---
[12:40:51 AM] Troy:
There’s a reason it’s not enabled as default or required, Few mailboxes enforce it, and we didn’t detect any usage of this form of exploit during the ICO
so it’s a good catch from the bounty program
[12:01:12 PM] Troy:
Let us know what you do in regards to this, We would approve of the bounty in this case, as its technically valid
No public disclosure would be require as it’s so low level and can’t be used to access anything sensitive at the domain elycoin.io.
[4:03:10 PM] Troy:
Whenever in the next few days is good for a call I’ll be around, I’m very flexible, and can provide an update on our end of things, We are ready for the token unlock and exchange listing and have provided some information on things to keep an eye on during this next period

--- Monday, July 9, 2018 ---
[2:23:19 PM] Troy:
Hey Leo our system picked up a transfer of ELY to an address we don’t have as belonging to Elysian, Can you look over the below Tx and confirm that’s all good
https://etherscan.io/address/0xd66aee5a6cab8a04f1f7ff0df36c27e8f6a16b45

We don’t have it In our list of your accounts and just wanted to verify

thanks troy
its verified
was from us
edited 
[2:37:11 PM] Troy:
Great thanks, We saw the other transfer and figured it was fine as that went to an address we have listed as owned by Elysian,
[6:13:10 PM] Leo:
Troy
about the CMC listing
can you please explain since I was planning to list a few hours after the Bitforex listing
[6:16:30 PM] Troy:
So if someone’s already sent in the application, once the trading volume hits $10k, that’s the only listing requirement they have for CMC, If that happens over the next day or so then you could be listed on CMC before BitForex trading opens
If you haven’t sent an application to CMC and you don’t want to be listed before BitForex trading opens, simply hold off on submitting the application and it won’t be picked up even if you hit $10k volume
[6:20:04 PM] Leo:
but you think someone already submitted
?
is there a paid option to speed up the process in case they need a couple of days?
[6:23:31 PM] Troy:
They do accept applications from the public so there is a chance someones already submitted it from the community, if that’s the case it should, there’s no paid listing option from what I’m aware of, and they make a point of saying “we will never ask for payment” on the application section.
The criteria for a cryptocurrency to be listed is the following:

- Must be a cryptocurrency or a crypto token.
- Must be on a public exchange with an API that reports the last traded price and the last 24 hour trading volume.
- Must have a non-zero trading volume on at least one supported exchange so a price can be determined.
- For market cap ranking, an accurate circulating supply figure is required.

If you'd like to have a cryptocurrency listed and it meets all of the criteria, please fill out the request form.
[6:31:36 PM] Leo:
I see
ill try to send in the application tomorrow after the Bitforex listing as well since I think the stats wont be correct anyways.
[6:33:17 PM] Troy:
Tomorrow after the listing would be best, BitForex is a supported exchange with a supported API, and there’s slowly volume growing on DEX’s but once it hits there that part will be fine
edited 
In my experience with CMC they don’t tend to stuff around like others, typically lists new coins quicker then other sites
[7:35:01 PM] Troy:
As I mentioned to Jesse, the token unlock and first exchange listing should be relatively quite from a security side of things, with a lack of airdrop/bounty tokens being sent out we aren’t expecting too much until then, other then the previously mentioned scams around exchange listing it’s looking good heading forwards :+1:🏻
[8:46:31 PM] Troy:
also I’ve emailed you on both the quotes for the after action report/marketing and invoice that’s still pending, if you could take a look over them and get those back to me before the listing so we can have some material out and ready
[8:47:35 PM] Leo:
About the security
what I was concerned about was actual hacks not that someone already found a way to hack the SC and is just waiting for the exchange listing.
[8:54:29 PM] Troy:
So your more worried about hacks of the Elysian site and team?
Like the sharpay hack you sent me?
[9:00:22 PM] Leo:
No that someone for example found a way to mint tokens which we didnt even mint yet. Or to somehow manipulate the SC itself etc.
[9:03:28 PM] Troy:
Ah I understand, With two audits of the SC something would of been caught by now, if the SC parameters change we would detect that, and exchanges wouldn't allow trading, it would freeze.

if someone had the ability to alter the SC, during the ICO the time to do it
edited 
[9:19:11 PM] Troy:
after an ICO, That entire plans relies on
1) users not knowing
2) the exchange not knowing
3) you or us not knowing
4) someone else not finding the explot and using it before them

both 2 and 3 won't happen, we would detect along with exchanges the change in the SC
and 4 would of already happened, If you find an exploit, someone else either already has or soon will
[9:47:06 PM] Troy:
both the website and SC are both secure and being monitored, Even though our service agreement is up as ive said before we are continuing to monitor both the Elysian website and SC for the forseable future so if anything was to change we would detect it and be able to action the correct response, exchanges have their own systems akin to this in place for this reason also
please feel free to fire away with any other concerns or questions you have, its what we are here for:+1:
[10:01:27 PM] Leo:
Sounds great! Thanks, Troy. Obviously let's still make sure that nothing happens at the time of the listing tomorrow. And regarding the call let's have it in a couple days once I have a bit free time to breath :sweat_smile:
[10:03:04 PM] Troy:
No problem, Having done this a few times I know how stressful and busy it gets after the ICO, and we will be on hand during the listing and beyond, as i mentioned to Jesse, the airdrop will be the next period we have concerns in regards to security about but lets get past this listing first :+1:
Get back to me with the few things in my email , Lets get this listing done  Then get rested and then we'll speak :grin:

Hey Leo, just wanted to update you from our side, Things on both the website and SC have been secure and safe overnight since the listing.

We detected an increase in activity online regarding the airdrop, We have some measures that can be implemented to help reduce the risk of users scamming the airdrop and dumping it.

Response to
In coordination with the release of the new Elysian Forum this week, the project will also be unveiling a brand new Crypto listing website…
[6:16:06 PM] Troy:
That’s something that’s going to go down very well with the current ICOBench downfall taking place, and a great use of the platform and token
I see why you’ve been unavailable recently!
[6:17:09 PM] Leo:
We want to make this a huge community thing, meaning we will add a special structure with the growth pool tokens so that we get thousands of people to help us to make this become super big. So two things:

1. in the future I will be adding your services to it to one of the verified partners so we can work out a structure for the fees and see what the best solution would be to perhaps whitelabel it to achieve better results etc.

2. for the moment we are planning to feature 100 projects for the launch in around 4 weeks, so in case you should know some interested projects which are top projects, let me know I will send you the details in a moment.
In coordination with the release of the Elysian Forum this week, we are launching an Crypto listing website as part of the forum that will integrate various blockchain projects within the Elysian community and ecosystem and will receive several benefits, such as:

- A premium project listing as one of the initial 100 projects on the website
- Email blast to over 70,000 addresses of real blockchain investors
- The capability of your token to be a method of payment in the future Elysian platform
- The availability of your token within the Elysian mobile wallet, to be transferred to and from the platform to transact for goods and services in merchants’ stores within the platform
- The use of the Elysian token (ELY) as a method of investment for participants in your ICO

For the first 25 projects the total cost of the package is $3,999.

We will have it up in around 4-5 weeks but the earliest projects would be integrated in the next upcoming emails etc.

It's more about the fact that they can use this to show their community that their token already has a use case by being integrated into our platform and mobile wallet making it available to over 2,000 businesses and much more customers when launched. After the first 25 projects it will be $7,999 and the commission is basically 10% for each project you would get on board. This is basically to help them to show their community that their token wont be just  a token for speculation that it will actually have a real use case.
What I need from your for point number 1 is all the services you offer with all the fees so we can work out a structure within the next couple weeks.

Those are some really good benefits that are able to be offered to them, The having their token already being a method of payment and wallet integration is a great idea.

I’ll speak with the team and get something made up covering a breakdown of our services and our offering
all-in-all I think its a great thing for Elysian and the Community,

Will be good to have this announced, are you planning on keeping it wrapped until post airdrop?
[6:28:09 PM] Leo:
we are planning to announce it later toady or tomorrow

thanks, ill talk with Jesse about it.
[10:28:04 PM] Troy:
From our inspection Elycoin doesnt contain the offending code
this was released in april so our system would of been loaded with the CVE and if it was detected would of been notified
and
"Medium user John Huxtable commented on the blog post that he thinks “it’s worth noting that batchTransfer isn’t a standard ERC20 function so only the contract owners which chose to implement it could be effected.”
so hence why its not in your code

Hi Leo, Just wanted to update you on the following in regards to the crypto listing website.

We are now partnered with TrackICO and currently speaking with other listing agencies at this time.

Once we've both got time and have sorted this out we should sit down and speak about what we can offer Elysian and the Elysian platform and the possibility of an exclusive agreement

I had another question
[5:23:59 PM] Troy:
No response from coingecko?
[5:24:10 PM] Leo:
right now we are working on a lock up contract a very simple one for the membership program is there a chance for you to just have a look to make sure its not hackable?
[5:29:13 PM] Troy:
I'll see if someone can have a quick look over it, When are you planing on launching the lockup?
is there a link to the repo for the contract?
Lockup on Jan 1st?
Unlock 12 months from that date
[5:36:39 PM] Leo:
we actually plan to start locking them whenever someone looked over it. It will be completed later toady.
today*
we have already a few people who are interested but I wouldnt like to risk getting hacked before letting them send their ELY.
[6:01:11 PM] Troy:

[8:46:42 AM] Troy:
Alright I’ll get that looked into also

We have a team that finishes on their deployment tomorrow, I can hold off assigning them for maybe 24 hours before I’d need to assign them elsewhere, I understand this is important to Elysian and would like to get this worked out for both of us.
Please get back to me on this matter ASAP
[6:25:10 PM] Troy:

Tuesday works for us, I’ll lock in Tuesday at the same time.

We’ve spoken with Jesse on a solution to the current situation and are just awaiting your response.

Get back to me over the weekend on it and I’ll keep a team locked away for Elysian, But if we head into the week without an update on that I’ll have to assign them to other work.
